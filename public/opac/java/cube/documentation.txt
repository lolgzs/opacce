OPTIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
direction	string	'random' :	The direction in which to rotate the cube. Possible values are 'random', 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'. Random chooses one of randomSelection for each transition.

randomSelection	string[] 	['up', 'down', 'left', 'right'] 	If the direction is 'random', then select one of these directions for each rotation of the cube. Possible values are 'up', 'down', 'left', 'right'.

speed	number	2000 	The number of milliseconds that it takes for each rotation to complete.

easing	string	'linear' 	The name of the easing to use for the rotation animation. This can be one of the jQuery UI effects when this code is included.

repeat	boolean	true 	Set to true to automatically rotate the cube to a new image after pausing the time below. Set to false to only rotate on demand.

pause	number	2000 	The number of milliseconds to pause between rotations of the cube.

selection	string	'forward' 	Determine how the next image to be shown is selected. The value should be one of 'forward', 'backward', or 'random'.

shading	boolean	true 	Set to true to add the shading for enhancing the 3D effects. Set to false to not apply shading.

opacity	number	0.8 	The maximum opacity for the highlight and shadow. Valid values are 0.0 to 1.0.

imagePath	string	'' 	Any extra path information required to locate the highlight and shadow images used by IE for the shading effects.

full3D	boolean	true 	Set to true to display a full 3D cube with perspective. Set to false to use the original ("flat") transition.

segments	number	20 	The number of segments to use for the full3D effect. A higher number gives a smoother look to the cube but means more work for the animation.

reduction	number	30 	The number of pixels by which the back edges of the cube are reduced for the full3D effect.

expansion	number	10 	The number of pixels by which the front edge of the cube is expanded for the full3D effect.

lineHeight	number[2]	[0.0, 1.25] 	The minimum and maximum line height (em) to use when "rotating" text.

letterSpacing	number[2]	[-0.4, 0.0] 	The minimum and maximum letter spacing (em) to use when "rotating" text.

beforeRotate	function	null 	A callback made just before each rotation starts. The function receives the current (shown) and next (to be shown) elements as parameters, while this refers to the containing division.

afterRotate	function	null 	A callback made just after each rotation ends. The function receives the current (just hidden) and next (just displayed) elements as parameters, while this refers to the containing division.

$(selector).imagecube({afterRotate: endedRotate}); 
     
function endedRotate(current, next) { 
    $('#rotateStatus').text('ended ' + $(current).attr('title') + 
        ' ? ' + $(next).attr('title'));
